            <br>
            IT is extremely useful to most modern businesses and it is impactful to businesses in a variety of ways. The practical uses of IT can be as small as a website which helps sell the business goods to having businesses relying on IT like online services. A lot of businesses have grown tremendously due to implementing IT in practice. <br>
            1.2 
            <br>
            The project must be planned out first. Research is a large factor when starting to plan a project. Utilizing this research then putting a plan in place which could also involve using a kankan board like trello with project deadlines and workflow will help improve the team’s ability to see where the project is at. Testing must also be done at nearly all stages of development to highlight issues and get them fixed before the project is released. <br>
            
            1.3
            <br>
            When carrying out tasks, it was extremely beneficial to have a trello board for task management. Moving through the workflow using this sort of agile method is very clear for all involved to see where the project is at, the risks and expectations. 
            
            Here is a link to the trello board for the development of this website.
            <br>

            <br>
            
            Risks could involve projects not meeting deadlines, over-promising and under-delivering could also lead to projects failing and being abandoned. Small problems must be identified and dealt with in order to maintain project progress.
            When developers are writing code, they must also keep in mind the future direction of the site. If they only build the site to the current expectation and take shortcuts, the code may not be re-usable when the other developers go to update it.<br>
            <br>
            1.5
            <br>
            
            The software we used for this project are all industry standard, well known and secure.
            We used:
            
            VSCode - Written by microsoft and used in all sorts of projects this software is widely known to be a great editor to use.
            Slack - communication on slack is great because it's so simple everyone can understand and use all the features on there.
            Teams - Group calls were needed for everything to go smoothly so using software which did this was necessary. <br>
            <br>
            1.6
            <br>
            
            Trello was really good to keep all the members on the same page and to keep track of the project as a whole. It was great to see all of the activity on the project and having an interactive kankan board was definitely worthwhile for the project.
            Git is very beneficial because you can have different branches which means you can work on development separately without submitting the changes to the main branch. This helps a lot with testing and regression testing to see where issues could potentially happen when merging branches. 
            Having these branches on git and being able to push updates in real time to the repository is incredibly useful. If you were to collaborate with other developers using github, the changes and push requests are visible so they can be reviewed by other peers working on the project.<br>
            
            1.7
            <br>
            With GDPR being in place, user's information is now secure and businesses must ask for the user's permission to use their data. This allows the users to have control of what information they give to the website.<br>

            2.1 
            <br>
            When creating this website, I used Visual Studio Code as my editor. It is well known and has many benefits like warnings, to show you where there are potential issues/conflict in the code, extensions which allow the user to change how the editor displays information or add functionality which is not there in the base program.
            Using VSCode was really familiar for creating the website as we had been using it for also writing Python Programs. There are many upsides to using VSCode but there are also other editors on the market which have things which VSCode does not.<br>
            <br>
            2.2 
            <br>
            
            For this project, we used trello, microsoft Teams, Slack and Visual Studio Code.
            Microsoft Teams was great for hosting meetings as we were able to share screens, have all members in a call and talk at the same time. A drawback to teams is that when not using it for business, we were restricted to 40 minutes per call. Working around this was a small issue which can be avoided.<br>
            <br>
            2.3 
            <br>
            Overall I am happy with my first website. I had to independently research Javascript to add the clock function on the landing page while also using all of the methods I had learned about HTML and CSS. I tried to keep the website simple and to have a use. It’s main function is a landing page, where the user will set as their homepage which has a pretty image as a background and can search using google from the landing page.
            If I was to redesign the site, I would love to look into using Javascript to also add animations, or potentially using a framework like React to make a living page.
            <br>
            <br>
            2.4 
            <br>
            
            If I had more experience I think I could have spent less time on the formatting/main skeleton creating and more time researching and creating the other functions I wanted to add. If I had another person working on the website with me, I would have loved to look into more in depth/complex ideas we could try to bring to light together.
            <br>
            2.5 
            <br>

            When creating the website, I used an extension called ‘Live Server’. This extension allowed me to run the site locally and see changes done in the code in real-time. This helped tremendously when formatting the site’s .css file and other pages as a small issue in the code could cause the page to break.
            Overall I think my site is fit for its purpose and I am happy with what I created after my first week of using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

            3.1 
            <br>
            As highlighted in the other outcomes, the use of VSCode, Teams and Trello were definitely needed or a substitute was needed for this sort of project. The productivity and efficiency of Teams, Slack and Trello is proven which is why it is used so heavily in IT projects and personal projects too.
            If I had a big team for the website, the trello board would be much more filled out and active. The planning and development side of the project would have had to be looked at as having more effective hours on the project would mean we could be more ambitious and have more people’s input on the final outcome of the project.<br>
            <br>
            3.2 
            <br>
            
            When the people working on the project are happy and passionate towards making the project succeed they are always going to give their best. Taking breaks, bouncing off of other people on the team and just having small discussions towards it all add to team building and the overall drive towards the project. I think great management, open discussion between the team and realistic expectations can make a team very productive and efficient.<br>
            <br>
            3.3
            <br>
            
            I personally found the trello board for the personal website a double edged sword. It was useful to have everything in one place to look at but it also took time out of the development and testing of the website. Because I was the sole person developing it, I knew what I wanted the website to look and function like, therefore I might not have needed a trello board as much as a team would need it.
            I also would have liked to have used a different video chatting service as I mentioned, the 40 minute timer on Microsoft Zoom’s service halted productivity for a few minutes every hour when we were on calls.
            There are free alternatives to this like Google hangouts or the business version of Slack.
            Slack was very useful for productivity for me as I love to talk to people on the same project for ideas, inspiration and to help each other out. I wouldn’t really need slack for a personal project like a solo website as communication would not be required.<br>
            <br>
            3.4 
            <br>
            When testing digital solutions, testing should be carried out at all stages of development.
            High risk issues should be highlighted first and visible to all the people who need to see it so they can be sorted and fixed before the project moves on. Ignoring issues like these found from testing during development could cause projects to fail in development. 
            Other issues should be analysed and weighed on whether the fix is worth the time and other potential risks from fixing it eg: does it break another function/component in the code.
            Utilizing Jira for bug tracking and TestRail for running tests are highly efficient and very customizable for any project. Using these however do cost and must be budgeted alongside the other parts of the project.

            The content on my page was all planned on the trello. the landing page will be the index.html and the others will be extra pages. I will have a interactive clock if I have time and the coursework on another page.

            When creating a website the people making it must be aware that when hosting the website all things on the website is owned or allowed to use by the respected owner. Without this it could lead to legal action being taken.

            To use an example, we could aid users who get migraines from looking at light screens and users who struggle to read with light backgrounds by creating a dark mode, which will change the brightness of the background to help with both of these issues.
            Recognising these issues and implented them is important to getting accessability for everyone who would like to use the product.

            When using HTML and CSS you would be using both a .html and .css files. 
            For images used on the website, you may need to add other files like .jpeg or .png.
            Adding audio would require .mp3 or .wav files for example.
            <br>
            If the user would like to implement JavaScript, they would also be utilising .js files.
            <br>
            1.8  <br>
            When creating the website, I created a folder which is solely used for the website and that alone.
            Inside this folder, all of the files required for the site are present and they are called upon inside the html/css/js files.
